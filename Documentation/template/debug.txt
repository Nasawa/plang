## IDE debugger

You must have setup VS Code(./IDE.md) and you should install VS Code plang extension
Warning: running in debug mode makes your code run about 10x slower
Press F5 on your keyboard or select from menu Run -> Start debugging from within VS Code
You can add breakpoints to your codes in VS Code
You can step through each step by pressing F10 in VS Code
You can run debug mode by adding `--debug` to your terminal command, e.g. 
```bash 
plang exec --debug
```

## Logger

it can be usefull when debugging to use the logger, you can change the logger level in few ways

you can start you app at a certain log levels
```bash
plang --logger=trace
```

you can set log leve on the goal, put it into the comment of the goal [trace], [debug], [info], [warning], [error].

```plang
/ This is the start [trace]
Start
- write out 'hello', logger=trace
```

you can define on the step, 

```plang
Start
- read file.txt into %content%, set log level: trace
```

## Write out 

the old fasion way of just writing out your variables for debuggin is also validates

```plang
Start
- write out %!Goal%
```
You will see what is in the %!Goal% object

## CSharp debugging

You can debug c# code by adding `--csdebug` to terminal command
You can debug c# code generated by plang or you can debug the plang source code
You will need to download the Plang project(https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/)
You will need to have Visual Studio installed, it is free, https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ Visual studio is only needed if debugging csharp code, this instruction to download should be displayed in this section
To debug c# code generated by plang, you need to extract the code, when in debug mode press Ctrl+Alt+U, or select from menu Debug -> Windows -> Modules
then search for the module name, it should be in the format of 01. NameOfModule.dll
then right click the module and select "Extract code"

How does the debugger work
When --debug parameter is added, you will notice Events folder appear, it 
will bind to run before each step in the goal files to call !SendDebug.goal
The SendDebug goal sends a post request to http://localhost:60877/ 
this server is started as soon as you start you VS code
the VS code plang extension recieves the data and displays it in the editor
