# Get Started
## Introduction
This guide assumes you have installed plang(Install.md)
We will start by making HelloWorld app, 
then create a Todo app on a webserver and then change it to a app running on your desktop.

## prereq
You must have installed plang
You should have VS Code as your editor with plang extension 



## Hello World
Video link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGW4btk34yQ

If you are using plang for the first time, you will need to fill up your plang service account(simple) or use gpt4 api key(advanced).

1. create folder HelloWorld in the location of your choosing, I like c:\plang\HelloWorld
2. Create Start.goal file
3. Write the following
```plang
Start
- write out 'Hello plang world'
```
4. Save the file
5. Press F5 or run it from console/terminal, 
```bash
plang exec
```
6. It should build your code and then run it, printing out to the screen "Hello plang world"

## Todo
Lets create the Todo app. In this video I go through it step by step with a bit more info then is provided here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abew4btk34

1. create folder Todo, at the location of your choosing, I like c:\plang\Todo
2. Create Setup.goal
```plang
Setup
- create table Todos 
    columns:    task(string, not null), due_date(datetime, not null), 
                completed(bool, false), created(datetime, now)
```
as you will notice, there is no Id column defined in the database structure. Plang will create that for you
and manage the id for the table. This is what will enable Event source, a very powerfull feature for syncing between devices.
3. We now need to build and run Setup.goal, this to create the table in the database.
```bash
plang exec Setup
```
4. Create Start.goal
```
Start
- start webserver
```
5. Create folder api
6. Create NewTask.goal
```plang
NewTask
- make sure that %task% and %due_date% is not empty, throw error
- insert into Todos %task%, %due_date%, write to %id%
- write out %id%
7. Create List.goal
```plang
List
- select everything from Todos, write to %list%
- write out %list%
```
8. Lets build and run the code, be sure you are located in the root of Todos folder. 
Press F5 or use console/terminal
```bash
plang exec
```
You now have a running webserver with logic. Next step is to insert some task and list them out.
9. Open up your favorite REST client or you could write it in plang. Lets start with rest client
the url is: http://localhost:8080/api/newtask
json body 
{
    "task":"Do homework",
    "due_date": "2023-27-12"
}
submit this using POST, you should get the id of the new task back.
Lets now get the task, 
the url is: http://localhost:8080/api/list using GET method
This should now list the task you created.
