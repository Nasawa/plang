all private keys are stored in .db/system.sqlite
they are not encrypted
the root private key is stored in global system.sqlite is stored at (give example of path)
    C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\plang\.db\system.sqlite on Windows
    /home/[Username]/plang/.db/system.sqlite on Linux
    /Users/[Username]/plang/.db/system.sqlite on macos

There are 3 private keys
- Encryption keys to encrypt & decrypt data
- Blockchain keys, used to sign requests that enables (%Identity%)[./Identity.md] and other blockchain related actions
- Nostr keys, used to send and recieve messages.

Exporting private keys
when you try to export private by calling ExportPrivate method, plang will ask the user 3 questions
the answer are sent to LLM which determines the liklyhood of the user being tricked, if it is high, plang blocks the export for 24 hours.
this is meant as a proof of concept, to help prevent social engineering on unsuspected users.

Make sure to backup critical private keys. This is important in early version of plang as the language does not provide any type of backup
