what are loops
create ELI5 explaination

Examples:


When you are going through a list, plang creates a new variable for you %item%

simple example

```plang
Start
- [code] generate list from 1 to 10, write to %numbers%
- go through %numbers%, call PrintNumber

PrintNumber
- write out %item%
```

## define you own %item% variable

you can define your own name for the %item% variable, in the example above, lets change %item% to %number%

```plang
Start
- [code] generate list from 1 to 10, write to %numbers%
- loop through %numbers%, call PrintNumber %number%=item

PrintNumber
- write out %number%
```

Lets write out all the files that is in our folder
```plang
Files
- get files in './', write to %files%
- foreach %files%, call !LoadText

LoadText
- write out 'Reading: %item.path%'
- read file %item.path% into %content%
- write out 'This is the content: %content%'
```


Lets see how it works with Http request, you can open https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts to see what it gives you

```plang
CatFacts
- GET https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts, write to %facts%
- go through %facts% !ShowFact fact=%item%

ShowFact
- write out '%fact.text% was created at %fact.createdAt%'
```

## Did you notice?

Did you notice that in each example, the instruction on how to go through the list was different? `loop through`, `foreach`, `go through`. Plang is code in natural language, just be clear on what you want to happen.


## Default Values in Loop Calls

When you use a loop in PLang, some default values are automatically available:

- `%list%`: The list you're looping through.
- `%item%`: The current item in the loop.
- `%position%`: The position of the current item. %position% starts at 0
- `%listCount%`: The total number of items in the list.


### Example with Default Values
```plang
ShowFact
- Write out "This is fact nr. %position% of %listCount%, this is the %item%, from %list%"
```

You can overwrite the default names of those values. This can be helpful to make your code clear or of the goal you are calling requires specific name.
```plang
Products
- select everything from products table, newest first, write to %products%
- go through %products% call !ProcessProduct %productList%=list, %product%=item, %productPosition%=position, %numberOfProducts%=listCount

ShowProduct
- write out "This is product nr. %productPosition% of %numberOfProducts%, this is the %product%, from %productList%"
```
