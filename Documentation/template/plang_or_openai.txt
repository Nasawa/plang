You can use plang service to build your code or if you have OpenAI api key you can use GPT4.

When you use plang service, you are supporting the project. 
The plang service cost excatly 2x what using Open AI key would cost.
To use plang service, you just start building. 

On first build, if you dont have any voucher on the plang service, you will be provided
with a payment link. Click that, choose the amount you want to buy for, something small to start with, like $5
fill in the creditcard information, and submit. 

The build again with plang, and you should be on your way.

# OpenAI
to use OpenAI key, you first need a api key(https://openai.com/). 
Next you need to download the OpenAI module into your project(https://github.com/PLangHQ/modules/OpenAIService), 
create folder modules

in you Start.goal file type in at the top

```plang
@llm=OpenAIService

Start
- write out 'hello world'
```
if you are using Events in plang, then instead of putting in Start.goal, it needs to go into your Events.goal file
```plang
@llm=OpenAIService

Events
- before app start, call !DoStuff
```


The strict format of "@llm=OpenAIService" allows the builder to pick it up and use it instead of the build
in plang service.

# Which is better
Plang service uses gpt4 from OpenAI, so there is no difference in results. 
Hopefully in the future we can provide you with faster and much cheaper service
By using our service your are supporting the project, development 
and hopefully enabling us to create a cheaper llm 
as the build process is relativly simple and doesn't need such a large LLM
