## Todo New Approach
Lets rethink how we are doing the todo app. (and for all apps in general) 

Lets look at how we create a todo list in the real world. We take pen and paper, and start writing down. This is natural to us. 

So lets do that.

Lets create a new folder `llm`, in there create `system.txt`, this is going to make simpler for us to change system commands to the llm without constantly rebuilding the code

Add this to your `system.txt` file
```txt
User will be provid you with a text of tasks. 
You job is to analyze the text and create list of tasks to return.

Current date & time is %Now%

task: the description of the task
due_date: when the task is due, if not defined, set default to 2 days from now
category: categorize the user input by 3 categories, 'Work', "Home", 'Hobby'
```

Lets create the file `NewLlmTask.goal` in `api` folder to 
```plang
NewLlmTask
- read file llm/system.txt, write to %system%, load vars
- [llm] system:%system%
        user: %request.tasks%
        scheme:[{task:string, due_date:date, category:string}]
        write to %taskList%
- for each %taskList%, call !SaveTask

SaveTask
- insert into Todos table, %item.task%, %item.due_date%, %Identity%
```

in the code apove, we read the system command to the llm, and send the users tasks that he sends in the http request, we define schema and write the result to `%taskList%` variable. then loop through the list and save each item to database.

tip: You can write `for each %taskList%, call !SaveTask %task%=item`, so you can reference the %task% variable in SaveTask goal

Lets test this now, create a new file in `test` folder, `TestNewLlmTask'

```plang
TestNewTask
- post http://localhost:8080/api/NewLlmTask
    {
        "tasks":"toothbrush
            toothpaste
            new oil for car, tomorrow
            milk
            talk with boss about salary, 2 days before end of month
            solve credit card payment in system, in 7 days
            "
    }
    write to %result%
- write out %result%
```
