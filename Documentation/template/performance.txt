Plang is slow, lets admit that
Plang runs everything using Reflections
how variables in Plang are access and set is not so fast

Here comes the but.... It doesnt really matter

So how doesn't it matter. Well Plang is not meant to write algroithms, looping through thousands of items. This is best done with regular operating languages.

Plang is great for business app, such as web services, SaaS, desktop apps, or even scripts

The simplified code that Plang allows you to write makes code simpler, fewer lines to execute. Lets take this example for a api request to get user info. Let's imagine you have the file `/api/GetUserInfo.goal`

```plang
GetUserInfo
- select id, name, email, address, zip from users where id=%userId%, write to %user%
- write out %user%
```

The code is simple, and it run just what it should.


you will also use Plang for things that dont require massive speed, e.g. it is automating things for you, something that a human takes minutes or hours to, that means that extra milliseconds dont really matter

Often you are using plang for slow things, where the "slowness" of the language becomes neglative, lets see example:

```plang
AskAI
- [llm] system: What is the sentiment of the user
    user: %user%
    scheme: {sentiment:"positive"|"neutral"|"negative"}
    write to %answer%
- write out %answer%
```

Here the llm, is going to take much much longer to respond and the extra 10ms that the language cost is neglatable.

On other front, it's good to know that

Plang has not been optimized in any way, reflection and the variable handling can be sped up multiple times
Plang will likely get pretty close to native c# speed, give it time
