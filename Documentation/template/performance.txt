Plang is slow, lets admit that
Plang runs everything using Reflections
how variables in Plang are access and set is not so fast

Here comes the but....

It has not been optimized in any way
so reflection and the variable handling can be sped up multiple times
It will most likely get close to native c# speed, give us time

the language also isn't maybe for something that requires massive speed, it is automating things for you, something that a human takes minutes or hours to, that means that extra milliseconds dont really matter
