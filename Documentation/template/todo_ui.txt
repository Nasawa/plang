## Todo window app
Lets change the previous todo web service into a window app. 

In this video I go through it step by step with a bit more info then is provided here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJYv5PUz9bY&list=PLbm1UMZKMaqfT4tqPtr-vhxMs4JGGFVEB&index=4

you will learn:
- how to create window app
- how to structure the layout
- how to call goals from your UI

-- Warning --
At version 0.1, it only runs on Windows. It should be available for all platforms(desktop, mobile, tablets, tv, etc.) in the future.
The window app is very early Alpha, it is more a proof of concept than a working thing.
-- Warning --

1. Change Start.goal
```
Start
- start window app, call !Todos
```
2. Create folder ui
3. Create Todos.goal
```plang
Todos
- select * from todos, where not completed, newest first, write to %todos%
- button, name="New task", call !NewTask
- table for %todos%
    header: Task, Due Date
    body:  task, due_date

4. Create NewTask.goal
```plang
NewTask
- form, inputs for "task" and "due_date"(DateTime)
- button "Save", call !SaveTask
```
5. Create SaveTask.goal
```plang
SaveTask
- if %task% or %due_date% is empty, throw error
- insert into Todos, %task%, %due_date%
- call !Todos
```

6. The app is now ready, lets run it but using plangw.exe (notice it's not plang.exe) 
    ```bash
    plangw exec
    ```
