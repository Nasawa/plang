Builder lifecycle

When you build plang code, it starts by building .goal files in the Events folder.
It then builds Setup.goal
Then Start.goal
Then the rest of goal files

Build Events

If you create EventsBuild.goal file in your events folder, you can enable events on the build process.

You can bind a build event that should execute a goal. The options are before and after goal build, and before and after step build.
This can be usefull to build development tools for plang.
An example would be to create a Goal that builds an unit test for a step after the step has been built.
```plang 
EventsBuild
- after step is built, call !CreateTest

CreateTest
- [llm] system: create unit test for the user intent...
    user: %__Step.Text__%
    scheme: {data:object}
    write to %testData%
- write %testData% to /tests/%__Step.Name__%
```

Another example would be to analyze if all variables in step are valid or to guide the developer to improve his code.
```plang 
EventsBuild
- before step is built, call !CheckVariables

CheckVariables
- write out 'Checking variables'
```
