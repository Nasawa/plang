Write Short introduction what conditions are.

Give ELI5 explanation on what conditions are, aimed at people that have not developed before and are learning how to develop.

Here are some plang examples on conditions

if statements can have sub steps or call other goals on true or false

if with sub steps

```plang
Start
- if %isAdmin% then
   - call !ShowAdmin
   - write out 'This is admin'
- if %isUser% then
   - call !ShowUser
   - write out 'This is user'
```

if statement that call other goals


```plang
Start
- if %isAdmin% then call !ShowAdmin, else !ShowUser
```

You cannot start steps with `- else` or `- else if`, those will not give any condition statement
