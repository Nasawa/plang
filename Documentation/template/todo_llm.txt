## Todo window app with LLM
Lets change the previous todo app to use LLM. 

We will learn how to use LLM in plang
We will also learn how to modify the database.
You will learn about run and forget.
How to focus the builder on specific module, e.g. [llm]

1. Change Setup.goal

*You will learn how to add column to existing table. *

Add the following step your Setup.goal file
```
- add column 'category' to tbl 'Todos'
```
After adding it, your Setup.goal file should look like this
```plang
Setup
- create table Todos 
    columns:    task(string, not null), due_date(datetime, not null), 
                completed(bool, false), created(datetime, now)
- add column 'category' to tbl 'Todos'                
```

2. Change NewTask.goal
I want to categories my tasks, but having the user doing that, 
makes for a more complex user experience, so lets deligate it to LLM

Lets modify NewTask.goal, like this
```plang
NewTask
- if %task% or %due_date% is empty, throw error
- insert into Todos, %task%, %due_date%, write to %id%
- call !Categorize, dont wait
- call !Todos

Categorize
- [llm]: system: categories the user input by 3 categories, 'Work', "home", 'hobby'
    user: %task%
    scheme: {category:string}
- update table tasks, set %category% where %id%
```

Explaination for plang code: 
when we say, 'call !Categorize, dont wait', we instruct plang not to wait for the response
of the !Categorize goal, this is because it is going to take a few seconds for the LLM to respond
and we don't want the user to wait.

using [llm] in the Categorize goal, indicates to the plang language that it should use
the LLM module, this is simply to help the language to detect what module to use. 
you can do this with any module, [http] would for the use of HttpModule,
[co] will suggest the language to build the code using CodeModule, ConditionModule, CompressionModule.
it simply does indexOf the module name from the content inside the []

scheme in the llm, forces the LLM to return specific structure. that structure is automatically loaded as a variable, as you can see we can access %category% in next step
scheme is not required, only when you want structured response. This is extremly powerfull.
for more on llm, check out the LlmModule doc[./modules/PLang.Modules.LlmModule.md]


3. ### Test the API Endpoints

You can test the API endpoints using your favorite REST client.

To create a new task, send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/api/newtask` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
    "task":"Buy some Lego",
    "due_date": "2023-27-12"
}    
```
Now if you open the http://localhost:8080/api/List, you should see that your new task has a category.


Using Plang to test it. Lets modify our `TestNewTask.goal` file (just change the task text)

- Modify `TestNewTask.goal` file in the `test` directory with the following code:

    ```plang
    TestNewTask
    - post http://localhost:8080/api/newtask
        {
            "task":"Buy some Lego",
            "due_date": "2023-27-12"
        }
        write to %result%
    - write out %result%
    ```

Then, execute the `TestNewTask.goal` file:

- Press F5 in VS Code, in the prompt window type in `TestNewTask` and press enter
- or if you prefer terminal

    ```bash
    plang exec test/TestNewTask
    ```

after this has executed, open  http://localhost:8080/api/List, you should see that your new task has a category.
