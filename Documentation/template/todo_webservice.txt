## Todo webservice
Lets create the Todo web service. 

You can also watch it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abew4btk34). There might be some insights that are not in the written guide.
There might be some insights that are not in the written guide.

1. create folder Todo, at the location of your choosing, I like c:\plang\Todo
2. Create Setup.goal
```plang
Setup
- create table Todos 
    columns:    task(string, not null), due_date(datetime, not null), 
                completed(bool, false), created(datetime, now)
```
as you will notice, there is no Id column defined in the database structure. Plang will create that for you
and manage the id for the table. This is what will enable Event source, a very powerfull feature for syncing between devices.
3. We now need to build and run Setup.goal, this to create the table in the database.
```bash
plang exec Setup
```
4. Create Start.goal
```
Start
- start webserver
```
5. Create folder api
6. Create NewTask.goal
```plang
NewTask
- make sure that %task% and %due_date% is not empty, throw error
- insert into Todos %task%, %due_date%, write to %id%
- write out %id%
7. Create List.goal
```plang
List
- select everything from Todos, write to %list%
- write out %list%
```
8. Lets build and run the code, be sure you are located in the root of Todos folder. 
Press F5 or use console/terminal
```bash
plang exec
```
You now have a running webserver with logic. Next step is to insert some task and list them out.
9. 
    Open up your favorite REST client.
    the url is: http://localhost:8080/api/newtask
    json body 
    {
        "task":"Do homework",
        "due_date": "2023-27-12"
    }
    submit this using POST, you should get the id of the new task back.

    Or create this in plang
    Create folder `test` in root of Todo folder
    Create file "NewTask.goal" in `test`
    ```plang
    NewTask 
    - post http://localhost:8080/api/newtask
        {
            "task":"Do homework",
            "due_date": "2023-27-12"
        }
    ```
    then execute it 
    ```bash
    plang exec test/NewTask
    ```

Lets now get the tasks, 
the url is: http://localhost:8080/api/list using GET method
This should now list the task you created.

Create file GetList.goal in `test`
    ```plang
    GetList 
    - get http://localhost:8080/api/list, write to %todos%
    - write out %todos%
    ```
    then execute it 
    ```bash
    plang exec test/GetList
    ```
