Files dont need to exists, the variable will simply be empty
No need to close streams, plang with handle that
Use relative path (/this/is/a/path) instead of absolute(c:\this\is\path)
When reading file, user can define to load variables. This is usefull for example when storing llm instruction in file, here is example

Filename: system.txt
```txt 
User name is %name%, make a funny joke around the name
```

Then plang reads the file and load the variables
```plang
Start
- set variable 'name' to 'Micheal'
- read system.txt into %system%, load variables
- [llm] system: %system%
    write to %result%
- write out %result%
