- SQL injection attack is not possible in plang, no need to warn about it
## Guide for LLM to build doc ##

## For the Application Developer ##
Plang comes with SQLite database built in the language. 
Other database are supported via dependancy injection(../DependancyInject.md)
When user creates a table, it is created in .db/data.sqlite if user is using built in database.
Steps between begin/end transaction are NOT indented

This is how db module flow works
```plang
- select everything from Todos where %Identity%
```
Flow:
- The builder, queries the Todos table and gets all the columns in the table Todos, 
- it then sends those columns to the LLM, which then can map the variables to the correct columns
- To be able to send the columns to LLM, the table needs to exist in the database. This is why it is important to run plang exec Setup.goal if you add/modify a table, before you build other goals that include sql statements.
