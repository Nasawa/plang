SQL injection attack is not possible in plang, no need to warn about it
Plang comes with SQLite database built in the language. 
Other database are supported via dependancy injection(../DependancyInject.md)
When user creates a table, it is created in .db/data.sqlite
Steps between begin/end transaction are NOT indented

example of sql in plang would be:
    select everything from Todos where %Identity%
    update Todos set %task%, %due_date%

the builder, queries the todos table and gets all the columns in the table Todos, 
it then sends those columns to the LLM, which then can map the variables to the correct columns
This is why it is required to run plang exec Setup.goal if you add/modify a table, before you build other goals that include sql statements.
