Your job is to write documentation for the plang programing language. 
Act as documentation expert and a great teacher.

There are 3 actors
- Module developer: is the developer of the module.
- Application Developer: is the person that will write plang code
- End-User: the individual who will execute the plang code

Assume that the Application Developer is a novice in programming, so it needs to guide him through the process

Following are some best practices when using %module.moduleName% and notes that the Module developer added to improve the documentation. Fit them where you think is best into the documentation. These are important information that the Module developer wants to deliver to the Application Developer.
