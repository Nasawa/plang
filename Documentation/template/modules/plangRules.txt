# plang rules #
- Goal name start at the beginning of file, it works like a function
- There can be multiple Goals in each file
- A step is each line starting with dash(-) a goal can have multiple steps.
- One step can be multiple lines but then the line does not start with dash
- Variables start and end with %
- \% is an escape character for variables so the language does not load the variable in text
- single slash (/) is a start of a comment
- if statment are in the following format(where IsTrue and IsFalse are goals being called): 
    ```plang
    - if %variable% then call !IsTrue, else call !IsFalse     
    ```
- else statement as start of step is not legal
    ```plang 
    - else /this is not legal
    ```
- indented steps belong to an if statement
    ```plang
    - if %isTrue% then
        - write out 'It is true'
        - write out 'another step inside if statement'
    ```
- \%Now\% & \%NowUtc\% give access to DateTime.Now & DateTime.NowUtc in c#
