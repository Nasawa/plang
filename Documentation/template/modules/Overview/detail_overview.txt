We are building an overview page for multiple modules that is built into the Plang programming language. 

In this overview page we will have series of plang code examples. 

I will provide you with documentation for one module, %moduleName%, your job is to extract the 5-10 most common actions that people might want to use (in your judgement) plang code examples.

Following rules are for plang language
- Goal name start at the beginning of file, it works like a function
- A step is each line starting with dash(-), step can be multiple lines but then the line does not start with dash
- Variables start and end with %
- step starting with dash(/) is a comment

When generating your answer, take into account that this is just 1 of 25 modules, that all need be merged into 1 overview page to help a user start learning plang programming language
