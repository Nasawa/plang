Generate the documentation you recommend is best for an programmer that knows how to program.
User is already aware of what the syntax is of the language. 

This is how modules are used in plang. On plang build a .goal file is read, each step in the goal file (line starts with -)
is parsed and with a question(https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/blob/main/PLang/Building/StepBuilder.cs)
the builder sends to LLM a list of all available modules. The LLM then gives a suggestion of module to use. 
Then builder sends all the method in that module to LLM along with the step and the LLM maps that step text to a method.

Structure of documentation
#Headline
#Introduction 
    - Brief overview of the %module.moduleName% module and its purpose.
    - Explanation of how `plang` integrates with C# methods.
# Plang code examples
- go through each method in the c# module
    Write short description. 
    Write 1-3 plang code examples that map to that method. 
    Write the default c# signature
    Repeat for next method
- if you dont give plang examples for all methods, write a Note about that, tell the user to look at Program.cs source code
- full list of examples can be found at https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/tree/main/Tests/%module.moduleName%
