# Plang IDE Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment for the Plang programming language. We will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and install a specific Plang extension for it.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website:

- [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

VS Code is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Installing the Plang Extension for VS Code

The Plang extension for VS Code allows you to write and debug your Plang code efficiently. Follow the steps below to install it:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open the Extensions view.
3. In the Extensions view, enter `Plang` in the search form and press `Enter`.
4. Locate the Plang extension by PlangHQ in the search results and click on the Install button.

Alternatively, you can visit the Plang extension page directly on the Visual Studio Marketplace:

Once the extension is installed, you will be able to start writing and debugging your Plang code in VS Code.
