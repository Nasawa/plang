## Desktop App
Now, let's convert our webserver app into a desktop app. 

1. Create a new folder DesktopApp at the location of your choosing, I like c:\plang\DesktopApp
2. Copy the contents of the Todo folder into the DesktopApp folder.
3. Modify the Start.goal file as follows:
```plang
Start
- start desktop app
```
4. Modify the NewTask.goal file as follows:
```plang
NewTask
- make sure that %task% and %due_date% is not empty, throw error
- insert into Todos %task%, %due_date%, write to %id%
- refresh UI
```
5. Modify the List.goal file as follows:
```plang
List
- select everything from Todos, write to %list%
- update UI with %list%
```
6. Now, let's build and run the code. Make sure you are located in the root of the DesktopApp folder. Press F5 or use the console/terminal:
```bash
plang exec
```
You now have a running desktop app with the same logic as your webserver. You can add tasks and list them out directly from your desktop.

## Conclusion
