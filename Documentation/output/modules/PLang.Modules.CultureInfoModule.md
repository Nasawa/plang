# CultureInfo

## Introduction

The `CultureInfo` module in PLang is a powerful feature that allows you to set and manage cultural information within your program. This includes settings for language, date formats, number formats, and more, which are essential for creating applications that support internationalization and localization.

## For Beginners

CultureInfo might sound complex, but it's essentially about making sure your program behaves correctly for users from different parts of the world. For example, people in the US write dates as month/day/year, while many Europeans write them as day/month/year. CultureInfo helps your program know which format to use based on the user's preferences or location.

In PLang, you can easily set the culture for your entire program or just the user interface (UI). This affects how dates, times, numbers, and text are displayed and interpreted.

## Best Practices for CultureInfo

When using `CultureInfo` in PLang, it's important to:

1. **Set the culture at the start of your program**: This ensures that all cultural settings are applied consistently throughout the execution.
2. **Use culture-specific formatting**: When displaying dates, times, and numbers, make sure they are formatted according to the set culture.
3. **Test with different cultures**: Ensure your program behaves correctly under different cultural settings by testing with various culture codes.

### Example: Setting and Using CultureInfo

```plang
CultureInfo
- set culture to en-US
- write out %date%

if %date% is 2/1/2024 then call !FormatAsUS, else !FormatAsEU
```

In this example, we set the culture to `en-US` (English - United States) and then write out a date. We also have a conditional statement that checks the date format and calls different functions based on the format.


# CultureInfo Module Examples

The `CultureInfo` module in PLang provides various settings for the program, such as culture, date, and number formatting. Below are examples of how to use the `CultureInfo` module in PLang, sorted by their expected popularity.

## Set Culture Language Code

This method sets the culture for the program based on a language code.

### Example 1: Set Culture to English (United States)

```plang
CultureInfo
- set culture to en-US
- write out 2.1.2024 21:45:04
```

### Example 2: Set Culture to Icelandic (Iceland)

```plang
CultureInfo
- set culture to is-is
- write out 2.1.2024 21:45:04
```

## Set Culture UI Language Code

This method sets the UI culture for the program based on a language code. It is similar to setting the culture language code but specifically affects the user interface.

### Example 1: Set UI Culture to English (United States)

```plang
CultureInfo
- set UI culture to en-US
- write out "The current UI culture is set to English (United States)."
```

### Example 2: Set UI Culture to Spanish (Spain)

```plang
CultureInfo
- set UI culture to es-ES
- write out "La cultura de la interfaz de usuario está configurada en español (España)."
```

Note: If a method returns a value, the result should be written to a variable, which can then be used in subsequent steps for demonstration purposes.

Remember to replace the language codes with the appropriate code for the culture you wish to set. The examples above use `en-US` for English (United States) and `is-is` for Icelandic (Iceland).

## Step Options

When writing your PLang code, you can enhance your steps with these options for better control and error handling:

- [CacheHandler](/modules/handlers/CachingHandler.md): Manage caching of data for improved performance.
- [ErrorHandler](/modules/handlers/ErrorHandler.md): Handle errors gracefully and maintain the flow of your program.
- [RetryHandler](/modules/handlers/RetryHandler.md): Automatically retry steps that fail due to transient issues.
: Manage cancellation of long-running operations.
: Execute steps without waiting for them to complete.
