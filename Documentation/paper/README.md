# Programming 3.0 - Theory

While creating plang I have written down the process, the ideas & vision, the potential and some details that might not be in this documentation. 

I've called it [Programming 3.0 - Theory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEEq2WyXJlm9vLSxoA7iI_jJ0FKtNOmw2RtfrBh447E/edit?usp=sharing)

It is a live document and might change over time. A pdf version that is fixed is in this repo.
