# Performance Considerations in Plang

While it's important to set realistic expectations about the performance of any programming language, it's equally crucial to understand the context in which it operates and the potential for optimization. 

Plang, admittedly, is not the fastest language out there, primarily due to its reliance on Reflections and the way variables are accessed and set. However, this is not the end of the story.

### Optimization Potential

The good news is that Plang has not yet been optimized in any way. 

There is significant room for improvement in both reflection usage and variable handling. With dedicated effort and time, it is expected that Plang's performance can be enhanced to approach that of native C# speeds.

### Context of Use

It's essential to consider the intended use case for Plang. 

Plang is designed for automation tasks, which often replace manual processes that could take humans minutes or hours to complete. In this context, the additional milliseconds or even seconds added by Plang's current performance are negligible. 

The language excels in scenarios where ease of automation and development speed are more critical than raw execution speed.

### Conclusion

It is slow (for now), but does it really matter for the things you will be using it for?
