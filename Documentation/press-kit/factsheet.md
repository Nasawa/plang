### PLang Fact Sheet

**Introduction:**
PLang is a pioneering programming language designed to blend natural language processing with traditional coding to create an intuitive and secure development environment. PLang introduces a new era in programming, referred to as Programming 3.0, by allowing developers to write code in any natural language, thus democratizing software development.

**Key Features:**

- **Natural Language Coding:** PLang allows developers to write code in their native language, making programming more accessible and intuitive.
- **Identity Solution:** PLang revolutionizes user authentication by eliminating traditional usernames and passwords, leveraging cryptographic-based identities for enhanced security and privacy.
- **Transparency and Collaboration:** All PLang-generated code is open for review, promoting a transparent development environment where developers can easily understand, modify, and collaborate on software projects.
- **Local Data Storage:** Emphasizing user privacy, PLang stores personal data locally on the user's device, reducing reliance on cloud storage and minimizing data breaches.
- **Encrypted Data Syncing:** Synchronization between devices is secure, with data being encrypted before leaving the user's device, ensuring privacy across platforms.
- **Verifiable Code:** PLang's design ensures that code is verifiable, fostering trust and reliability in software applications developed with PLang.
- **Containerized Apps:** Each app runs in its own container, limiting access to the system and enhancing security by isolating app environments.

**Security and Privacy:**

PLang is built with a strong focus on security and privacy, incorporating features that protect both developers and end-users:

- **Secure Code Execution:** PLang introduces a layer of abstraction that restricts code execution to safe, allowed operations, significantly reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.
- **User Privacy:** With PLang, user authentication no longer requires personal information, safeguarding user identity and data.
- **Data Encryption:** Data synchronization between devices is encrypted, ensuring that user information remains confidential and secure.

**Development Environment:**

- **Folder Structure:** PLang organizes apps in a hierarchical structure, with each app containing its own private keys and data, maintaining separation and security between different applications.
- **Verifiable Deployments:** Applications deployed with PLang require signing, ensuring code integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications.
- **IDE Support:** While PLang requires a new IDE for optimal usage, an extension for VisualCode has been developed to facilitate development.

**Future Goals:**

- **Self-Hosting:** One of PLang's aspirations is to become self-hosting, meaning PLang will be written in PLang itself. This goal demonstrates the language's completeness and robustness.
- **Open Source and Community-Driven:** PLang aims to be an open-source project, encouraging community involvement in its development and evolution. This approach ensures a wide range of contributions, fostering innovation and inclusivity.
- **Enhanced Security Features:** Ongoing development will focus on enhancing PLang's security features, ensuring it remains at the forefront of secure programming practices.
- **Improved Data Synchronization:** Future versions of PLang will seek to optimize data synchronization techniques, making the process more efficient and secure.
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing:** PLang intends to incorporate more extensive unit testing capabilities, making it easier for developers to build reliable and robust applications.

These future goals outline PLang's commitment to growth, security, and community engagement, promising a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem for developers and users alike.
