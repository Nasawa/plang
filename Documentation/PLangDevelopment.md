# PLang Development Guide

Welcome to the PLang Development Guide! This document is designed to help you contribute to the development of the PLang programming language. Whether you're interested in improving documentation, writing code, or developing modules and services, your contributions are valuable to us. Below you'll find various ways you can get involved and the resources you'll need to get started. 

## Contributing to Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for any programming language. If you have suggestions for improvements or corrections, we welcome your contributions:

- **Improve Documentation**: If you notice any errors or areas for improvement in our documentation, you can help by sending us a pull request. Visit our documentation repository on GitHub to make your changes: [PLang Documentation](https://github.com/PLangHQ/plang/tree/main/Documentation).

## Contributing to Code

If you're interested in contributing to the core of PLang, you'll need to be familiar with C# and have the appropriate development environment set up:

- **Development Environment**: To work on PLang's codebase, you'll need to install Visual Studio Community. You can download it from the official site: [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

- **Code Contributions**: Once you have your development environment set up, you can contribute to the C# codebase. Check out the issues on our GitHub repository or propose new features or improvements.

## Developing Modules and Services

PLang is designed to be powerful and extensible. If you're interested in expanding its capabilities:

- **Create Modules**: Develop new modules that add functionality to PLang. Share your modules with the community by submitting them to our repository.

- **Develop Services**: Contribute to existing services or create new ones that enhance the PLang ecosystem.

## Join the Community

Engage with other PLang developers and users by joining our community platforms:

- **Discord**: Connect with the PLang community on Discord for real-time discussions. Join us here: [PLang Discord](https://discord.gg/A8kYUymsDD).

- **Discussion Board**: Participate in discussions, ask questions, and share your ideas on our GitHub discussion board: [PLang Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/PLangHQ/discussions).

## Getting Started with PLang

Before you begin contributing, it's important to familiarize yourself with the PLang language. Here's a brief overview of the syntax and structure:

- **Goal Name**: The goal name in PLang acts as the entry point of the program, similar to a main function in other languages. It should be declared at the beginning of the file.

- **Steps**: Each action in PLang is defined by a step, which starts with a dash (-). If a step spans multiple lines, subsequent lines should not start with a dash.

- **Variables**: In PLang, variables are denoted by percent signs (%) surrounding the variable name, e.g., `%variableName%`.

- **Comments**: To add comments to your PLang code, start the line with a dash followed by a forward slash (-/). Comments are ignored during execution.

Here's a simple example of a PLang code snippet:

```plang
Goal: ExampleGoal
- Set %myVariable% to "Hello, PLang!"
- Display %myVariable%
-/ This is a comment and will not be executed
```

We hope this guide helps you get started with contributing to PLang. Your efforts will help make PLang a more robust and user-friendly language for everyone. Thank you for your interest in PLang development!
