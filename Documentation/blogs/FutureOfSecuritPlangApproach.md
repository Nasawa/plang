## The Future of Security: A New Approach with Plang

I’ve always been a firm believer in striving for 100% security because without it, you can't truly have 100% privacy. 

Sure, reaching that perfect 100% is pretty much impossible, but the idea is to minimize risks down to just one crucial point—something manageable. That way, all your efforts can be focused on protecting that single point.

Now, let’s talk about [Plang](https://plang.is). 

Plang gives you something pretty special: signatures. 

This means that every piece of data you send is secure in every possible way, except for one thing—the private key. 

So, Plang boiles it all down to protecting this one point. How do we do that? Today, we rely on things like fingerprints, PINs, face scans, and other devices. These methods give us solid security around that private key. You define you security and say, "Okay, any money transfer over $30 needs my thumbprint or face scan, and anything over $100 needs both my face and a PIN."

You might be wondering how this works in Plang. 

It’s simple—you can see it in the code. When it says "sign," it’s calling the Sign function in C#. This function asks your hardware for your private key. The code is clean, with very little room for manipulation. So, the main thing left to do is to protect your computer. But we’ll set that aside for now; you can dive into that in “how to protect your computer.”

So, what’s the big deal with Plang? 

It’s not just another language like Kotlin or the hundred others out there. No, it’s a layer on top of those languages. What does that mean? 

Any SaaS service with an API can implement Plang in just a few hours and immediately get better security than they’ve ever had. Here’s how it works: they submit the username and password, and all requests are signed. Now, this signature is tied to that username and password. From there, they can use all the APIs associated with that user ID. It’s all about identity—your user ID.

Now, you might be thinking, 
> "So there’s a browser, right?"

Actually, no. There’s no browser. 

> "Then how do I use the service?" 

Well, there’s an app on your device—be it your computer, phone, watch, TV, whatever.

 That app is your interface. 
 
 > "Wait a minute, so the user interface is on my device?" 
 
 Yep. 
 
 > "But my data is in the cloud, right?" 
 
 Nope. Your data is on your device. 
 
 > "What do you mean?" 
 
 Okay, let’s take Trello as an example. I love Trello—I’ve been a user since the beginning. The number one thing about Trello is that you can add a task on your computer and see it on your phone, all synced up. 
 
 Here’s where Plang changes the game: your data stays on your device. It’s synced directly between your devices, not through some third-party cloud service.

In a nutshell, Plang is here to change the way we think about security. 

By focusing on securing that one crucial point—the private key—Plang makes everything simpler and a whole lot more secure. In a world where digital threats are constantly evolving, innovations like this are exactly what we need to keep our data safe and our privacy intact.
