# Lesson 1: What is Plang & Setting Up Your Environment

If you don't know what Plang is, in short, it's a programming language that allows you to write code in natural language. It simplifies programming new applications immensely.

The best way to understand and learn Plang is to build in it.

You should set up your environment, let's do that.

- Go to [Install](../Install.md) and follow the instructions to install Plang.

And since you are here to develop Plang apps:

- Go to [IDE](../IDE.md) to install the dev environment.

Now that you have installed Plang, let's [continue to Lesson 2 - Basic Concepts in Plang](./Lesson%202.md).
